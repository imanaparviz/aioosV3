What is a context

Contexts

are used to allow child components to access parent state without having to pass it down the component tree via props. However, this means that if a component depends on a context, you must make sure that context is provided somewhere up the component tree.

// ✅ This works!

// ConnectionState depends on the RoomContext which is provided by LiveKitRoom.

<

LiveKitRoom

>

<

ConnectionState

/>

</

LiveKitRoom

>

// ✅ This works!

// The context provider (LiveKitRoom) does not have to be a immediate parent of the component (ConnectionState) needing the context.

<

LiveKitRoom

>

<

div

>

<

ConnectionState

/>

</

div

>

</

LiveKitRoom

>

// ❌ This will cause an error!

// ConnectionState depends on a parent component to provide the RoomContext.

<

LiveKitRoom

>

</

LiveKitRoom

>

<

ConnectionState

/>

If you only use LiveKit Components without creating custom components yourself, you don't need to interact with the contexts. Just make sure that the component tree meets the context requirements of all components. If it doesn't, you'll get an error message telling you which context is missing.

The two most important contexts are:

Room context

The

RoomContext

provides the

Room

object as a context. While previously this was primarily provided through the

LiveKitRoom

component, we recommend using

RoomContext.Provider

directly:

const

MyApp

=

(

)

=>

{

const

[

room

]

=

useState

(

(

)

=>

new

Room

(

)

)

;

useEffect

(

(

)

=>

{

room

.

connect

(

'server-url'

,

'user-access-token'

)

;

return

(

)

=>

room

.

disconnect

(

)

;

}

,

[

room

]

)

;

return

(

<

RoomContext.Provider

value

=

{

room

}

>

{

/* Components that need room context */

}

<

ConnectionState

/>

</

RoomContext.Provider

>

)

;

}

;

This approach gives you more control over the Room lifecycle while still providing the necessary context for all LiveKit components.

Participant context

The

ParticipantContext

provides a

Participant

object to all child components.

/* 1️⃣ ParticipantTile provides the ParticipantContext. */

<

ParticipantTile

>

{

/* 2️⃣ ParticipantName uses the ParticipantContext to get the participant name. */

}

<

ParticipantName

/>

</

ParticipantTile

>

Accessing contexts

Context access is not required to build an application using LiveKit Components. However, if you want to build custom components that depend on a context, you can use one of the hooks we provide.

For example, you can use the

useRoomContext

hook to access the

Room

object and the

useParticipantContext

hook to access the

Participant

object.
