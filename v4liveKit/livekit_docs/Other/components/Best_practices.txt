Use LiveKit components for lower-level features

You can create custom React components for your LiveKit app. For lower-level features (for example, mic toggle),

however, LiveKit components are built using utility state handling hooks. LiveKit strongly recommends you use

these instead of creating your own implementation because they manage React state handling and have been rigorously

tested. Lower-level features include input device toggling, and audio and video tracks:

StartAudio

StartMediaButton

TrackToggle

TrackLoop

If you do create custom components, use the provided hooks for state. For example, to create a custom mic toggle

button, use

useTrackToggle

:

const

{

buttonProps

,

enabled

}

=

useTrackToggle

(

props

)

;

return

(

<

button ref

=

{

ref

}

{

...

buttonProps

}

>

{

(

showIcon

??

true

)

&&

getSourceIcon

(

props

.

source

,

enabled

)

}

{

props

.

children

}

<

/

button

>

)

;

Using hooks for current state

LiveKit recommends using

hooks

to get

the most current information about room state. For example, to get a list of active tracks or participants in a room:

useParticipants

useTracks

Updating props for the LiveKitRoom component

Updating props for the

LiveKitRoom

component should

not

result in the component being repeatedly unmounted and

remounted. This results in

Client initiated disconnect

errors and cause users to be repeatedly disconnected and

reconnected to the room.
