There are two primary methods for rendering (making audio tracks audible) audio with React Components, each offering distinct benefits and suited for different use cases.

Render all audio tracks within the room

The

RoomAudioRenderer

component simplifies audio management in LiveKit Rooms by rendering all audio tracks together.

It's a straightforward and often optimal solution. Just import

RoomAudioRenderer

and place it in your

LiveKitRoom

component for seamless audio integration.

Tip

Utilizing the

RoomAudioRenderer

ensures automatic benefits from future server side performance enhancements without requiring any modifications to your existing code.

Full control and ownership of the audio rendering process

For complete control over individual audio Tracks, including muting and volume adjustments at the track level, you can craft a custom audio renderer using the

useTracks

hook alongside the

<AudioTrack/>

component. For example, this level of control can be used to create spatial audio applications where you may want to adjust each audio track based on the distance between participants.

const

tracks

=

useTracks

(

[

Track

.

Source

.

Microphone

,

Track

.

Source

.

ScreenShareAudio

,

Track

.

Source

.

Unknown

,

]

)

.

filter

(

(

)

=>

!

isLocal

(

)

&&

kind

Audio

)

;

return

(

<

div style

=

{

{

display

:

'none'

}

}

>

{

tracks

.

map

(

(

trackRef

)

=>

(

<

AudioTrack

key

=

{

getTrackReferenceId

(

trackRef

)

}

trackRef

=

{

trackRef

}

volume

=

{

volume

}

muted

=

{

muted

}

/

>

)

)

}

<

/

div

>

)

;

Depending on your application it is possible that audio tracks have an unknown source. To render these as well, we include the

Track.Source.Unknown

in the array of sources passed to the

useTracks

hook, but then filter out the tracks that are not of kind

Audio

.
