Overview

LiveKit Cloud includes advanced models licensed from

Krisp

to remove background noise and ensure the best possible audio quality. The models run locally, with no audio data sent to Krisp servers as part of this process and negligible impact on audio latency or quality.

The feature includes a background voice cancellation (BVC) model, which removes extra background speakers in addition to background noise, providing the best possible experience for voice AI applications. You can also use the standard NC model if desired.

The following comparison shows the effect of the models on the audio as perceived by a user, and also as perceived by a voice AI agent running an STT model (

Deepgram Nova 3

in these samples). The segments marked with a strikethrough indicate unwanted content that would confuse the agent. These samples illustrate that BVC is necessary to achieve clean STT in noisy multi-speaker environments.

Try the free

noise canceller tool

with your LiveKit Cloud account to test your own audio samples.

Hi there, can you hear me alright?

pretty bad

Sorry it's pretty noisy in the taxi.

sorry i can hear you pretty soon

Okay so as I was saying I just heard about this platform called LiveKit - it's an all in one platform for voice AI agents with some pretty cool features. Have you heard about it?

Supported platforms

You can apply the filter in the frontend ("outbound") with plugins for JavaScript, Swift, and Android, or directly inside of your agent code ("inbound"). The BVC model is available only within your agent, using the Python or Node.js plugins. LiveKit also offers an NC model for SIP-based telephony, which can be enabled with a flag in the trunk configuration.

The following table shows the support for each platform.

LiveKit SIP documentation

Usage instructions

Use the following instructions to integrate the filter into your app, either inside of your agent code or in the frontend.

Tip

Leaving default settings on is strongly recommended. Learn more about these defaults in the

Noise & echo cancellation

docs.

LiveKit Agents

The following examples show how to set up noise cancellation inside your agent code. This applies noise cancellation to inbound audio and is the recommended approach for most voice AI use cases.

Tip

When using noise or background voice cancellation in the agent code, do not enable Krisp noise cancellation in the frontend. Noise cancellation models are trained on raw audio and might produce unexpected results if the input has already been processed by Krisp in the frontend.

Standard noise cancellation and the separate echo cancellation feature can be left enabled.

Installation

Install the noise cancellation plugin:

Python

Node.js

uv

add

"livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation~=0.2"

pnpm

add

@livekit/noise-cancellation-node

Usage

Include the filter in the room input options when starting your agent session:

Python

Node.js

from

livekit

.

plugins

import

noise_cancellation

# ...

await

session

.

start

(

# ...,

room_input_options

=

room_io

.

RoomInputOptions

(

noise_cancellation

=

noise_cancellation

.

BVC

(

)

,

)

,

)

# ...

import

{

BackgroundVoiceCancellation

}

from

'@livekit/noise-cancellation-node'

;

// ...

await

session

.

start

(

{

// ...,

inputOptions

:

{

noiseCancellation

:

BackgroundVoiceCancellation

(

)

,

}

,

}

)

;

// ...

Usage with AudioStream

Apply the filter to any individual inbound AudioStream:

Python

Node.js

from

livekit

.

rtc

import

AudioStream

from

livekit

.

plugins

import

noise_cancellation

stream

=

AudioStream

.

from_track

(

track

=

track

,

noise_cancellation

=

noise_cancellation

.

BVC

(

)

,

)

import

{

BackgroundVoiceCancellation

}

from

'@livekit/noise-cancellation-node'

;

import

{

AudioStream

}

from

'@livekit/rtc-node'

;

const

stream

=

new

AudioStream

(

track

,

{

noiseCancellation

:

BackgroundVoiceCancellation

(

)

,

}

)

;

Available models

There are three noise cancellation models available:

Python

Node.js

# Standard enhanced noise cancellation

noise_cancellation

.

NC

(

)

# Background voice cancellation (NC + removes non-primary voices

# that would confuse transcription or turn detection)

noise_cancellation

.

BVC

(

)

# Background voice cancellation optimized for telephony applications

noise_cancellation

.

BVCTelephony

(

)

import

{

// Standard enhanced noise cancellation

NoiseCancellation

,

// Background voice cancellation (NC + removes non-primary voices

// that would confuse transcription or turn detection)

BackgroundVoiceCancellation

,

// Background voice cancellation optimized for telephony applications

TelephonyBackgroundVoiceCancellation

,

}

from

'@livekit/noise-cancellation-node'

;

Telephony

Noise cancellation can be applied directly at your SIP trunk for inbound or outbound calls. This uses the standard noise cancellation (NC) model. Other models are not available for SIP.

Inbound

Include

krisp_enabled: true

in the inbound trunk configuration.

{

"trunk"

:

{

"name"

:

"My trunk"

,

"numbers"

:

[

"+15105550100"

]

,

"krisp_enabled"

:

true

}

}

See the full

inbound trunk docs

for more information.

Outbound

Include

krisp_enabled: true

in the

CreateSipParticipant

request.

request

=

CreateSIPParticipantRequest

(

sip_trunk_id

=

"<trunk_id>"

,

sip_call_to

=

"<phone_number>"

,

room_name

=

"my-sip-room"

,

participant_identity

=

"sip-test"

,

participant_name

=

"Test Caller"

,

krisp_enabled

=

True

,

wait_until_answered

=

True

)

See the full

outbound call docs

for more information.

Frontend

The following examples show how to set up noise cancellation in the frontend. This applies noise cancellation to outbound audio.

JavaScript

Android

Swift

React Native

Flutter

Tip

When using noise or background voice cancellation in the frontend, do not enable Krisp noise cancellation in the agent code.

Standard noise cancellation and the separate echo cancellation feature can be left enabled.

Installation

npm

install

@livekit/krisp-noise-filter

This package includes the Krisp SDK but not the models, which downloads at runtime to minimize the impact on your application's bundle size.

React components usage

LiveKit Components includes a convenient

useKrispNoiseFilter

hook to easily integrate Krisp into your React app:

import

{

useKrispNoiseFilter

}

from

'@livekit/components-react/krisp'

;

function

MyKrispSetting

(

)

{

const

krisp

=

useKrispNoiseFilter

(

)

;

return

(

<

input

type

=

"

checkbox

"

onChange

=

{

(

ev

)

=>

krisp

.

setNoiseFilterEnabled

(

ev

.

target

.

checked

)

}

checked

=

{

krisp

.

isNoiseFilterEnabled

}

disabled

=

{

krisp

.

isNoiseFilterPending

}

/>

)

;

}

Base JS SDK usage

For other frameworks or advanced use cases, use the

KrispNoiseFilter

class directly:

import

{

type

LocalAudioTrack

,

Room

,

RoomEvent

,

Track

}

from

'livekit-client'

;

const

room

=

new

Room

(

)

;

// We recommend a dynamic import to only load the required resources when you enable the plugin

const

{

KrispNoiseFilter

}

=

await

import

(

'@livekit/krisp-noise-filter'

)

;

room

.

on

(

RoomEvent

.

LocalTrackPublished

,

async

(

trackPublication

)

=>

{

if

(

trackPublication

.

source

===

Track

.

Source

.

Microphone

&&

trackPublication

.

track

instanceof

LocalAudioTrack

)

{

if

(

!

isKrispNoiseFilterSupported

(

)

)

{

console

.

warn

(

'Krisp noise filter is currently not supported on this browser'

)

;

return

;

}

// Once instantiated, the filter will begin initializing and will download additional resources

const

krispProcessor

=

KrispNoiseFilter

(

)

;

console

.

log

(

'Enabling LiveKit Krisp noise filter'

)

;

await

trackPublication

.

track

.

setProcessor

(

krispProcessor

)

;

// To enable/disable the noise filter, use setEnabled()

await

krispProcessor

.

setEnabled

(

true

)

;

// To check the current status use:

// krispProcessor.isEnabled()

// To stop and dispose of the Krisp processor, simply call:

// await trackPublication.track.stopProcessor()

}

}

)

;

Available models

The JavaScript noise filter supports only the standard noise cancellation (NC) model.

Compatibility

Not all browsers support the underlying Krisp SDK (including Safari <17.4). Use

isKrispNoiseFilterSupported()

to check if the current browser is supported.

Tip

When using noise or background voice cancellation in the frontend, do not enable Krisp noise cancellation in the agent code.

Standard noise cancellation and the separate echo cancellation feature can be left enabled.

,

from

:

"0.0.7"

)

,

Usage

Here is a simple example of a SwiftUI app that uses Krisp in its root view:

import

LiveKit

import

SwiftUI

import

LiveKitKrispNoiseFilter

// Keep this as a global variable or somewhere that won't be deallocated

let

krispProcessor

=

LiveKitKrispNoiseFilter

(

)

struct

ContentView

:

View

{

@StateObject

private

var

room

=

Room

(

)

var

body

:

some

View

{

MyOtherView

(

)

.

environmentObject

(

room

)

.

onAppear

{

// Attach the processor

AudioManager

.

shared

.

capturePostProcessingDelegate

=

krispProcessor

// This must be done before calling `room.connect()`

room

.

add

(

delegate

:

krispProcessor

)

// You are now ready to connect to the room from this view or any child view

}

}

}

For a complete example, view the

Krisp sample project

.

Available models

The Swift noise filter supports only the standard noise cancellation (NC) model.

Compatibility

The Krisp SDK requires iOS 13+ or macOS 10.15+.

If your app also targets visionOS or tvOS, you'll need to wrap your Krisp code in

#if os(iOS) || os(macOS)

and

add a filter to the library linking step in Xcode

.

Tip

When using noise or background voice cancellation in the frontend, do not enable Krisp noise cancellation in the agent code.

Standard noise cancellation and the separate echo cancellation feature can be left enabled.
