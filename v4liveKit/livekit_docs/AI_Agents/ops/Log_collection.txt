Overview

LiveKit Cloud provides realtime logging for your deployed agents, helping you monitor performance, debug issues, and understand your agent's behavior in production. Logs are collected from all phases of your agent's lifecycle—from build to runtime—and can be forwarded to external monitoring services such as

Datadog

,

CloudWatch

,

Sentry

, and

New Relic

. You can also view some logs with the LiveKit CLI. LiveKit Cloud does not store runtime logs.

Log types

LiveKit Cloud collects two types of logs for your agents:

Runtime logs

: Your agent's app logs, including stdout, stderr, and any other

logging

you implement.

Build logs

: Output from the container build process, including Dockerfile execution and dependency installation.

Follow runtime logs

Use the LiveKit CLI to follow logs from your deployed agents in realtime.

lk agent logs

This command continuously streams logs from the latest running instance of your agent. It also includes a short snapshot of recent logs.

Single instance

The LiveKit CLI only shows logs from the newest worker instance of your agent, which can include multiple jobs. All logs from this worker are included, but it is not a comprehensive view of all logs from all instances for agents running at scale. To collect logs from all instances, use an external logging service by using the

Forward runtime logs

feature.

View build logs

Use the LiveKit CLI to view the Docker build logs from the currently deployed version of your agent.

lk agent logs --log-type

=

build

This command prints the logs to stdout, but does not perform a live tail.

Build logs from more versions of your agent are available in the

LiveKit Cloud dashboard

.

Forward runtime logs

Forward your agent logs to external monitoring services for long-term storage, advanced analytics, and integration with your existing observability stack.

The currently supported destinations are Datadog, CloudWatch, Sentry, and New Relic.

Datadog integration

Add a

Datadog

client token as a

secret

to automatically enable log forwarding. If your account is in a region other than

us1

, you can also set the region. All runtime logs are automatically forwarded to your Datadog account.

lk agent update-secrets

--secrets

"DATADOG_TOKEN=your-client-token"

DATADOG_TOKEN

string

Required

#

Your Datadog

client token

.

DATADOG_REGION

string

Optional

Default:

us1

#

Your Datadog region. Supported regions are

us1

,

us3

,

us5

,

us1-fed

,

eu

, and

ap1

.

Log fields

The following log fields are set in Datadog for all log lines sent from LiveKit Cloud:

Field

Value

Description

host

<worker-id>

A unique identifier for the specific worker instance emitting the log.

source

<agent-id>

The ID of the agent, as in

livekit.toml

and the dashboard,

service

"cloud.livekit.io"

stream

stdout

or

stderr

Indicates whether the log originated from stdout or stderr.

CloudWatch integration

Add a

CloudWatch

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

and

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

as

secrets

to automatically enable log forwarding. The AWS region defaults to

us-west-2

, you can set it by setting the

AWS_REGION

secret. All runtime logs are automatically forwarded to your CloudWatch account.

lk agent update-secrets

--secrets

"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id"

--secrets

"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key"

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

string

Required

#

Your AWS

access key ID

.

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

string

Required

#

Your AWS

secret access key

.

AWS_REGION

string

Optional

Default:

us-west-2

#

Your AWS region. See the

AWS regions

page for a list of all supported regions.

Sentry integration

Add a

Sentry

SENTRY_DSN

as a

secret

to automatically enable log forwarding. All runtime logs are automatically forwarded to your Sentry account.

lk agent update-secrets

--secrets

"SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn"

SENTRY_DSN

string

Required

#

Your Sentry

DSN

.

New Relic integration

Add a

New Relic

NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY

as a

secret

to automatically enable log forwarding. All runtime logs are automatically forwarded to your New Relic account.

lk agent update-secrets

--secrets

"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key"

NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY

string

Required

#

Your New Relic

license key

.

Log levels

Your agent worker configuration determines the log levels that are collected and forwarded. The default log level is

INFO

. To use a different value, set the log level in your Dockerfile:

CMD ["python", "agent.py", "start", "--log-level=DEBUG"]

For more information on log levels, see the

worker options

page.

Log retention

LiveKit Cloud does not store runtime logs. Build logs are stored indefinitely for the most recently deployed version.
