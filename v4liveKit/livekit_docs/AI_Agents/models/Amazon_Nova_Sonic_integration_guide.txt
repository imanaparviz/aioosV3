Nova Sonic

is a state of the art speech-to-speech model with a bidirectional audio streaming API. Nova Sonic processes and responds to realtime speech as it occurs, enabling natural, human-like conversational experiences. LiveKit's AWS plugin includes support for Nova Sonic on AWS Bedrock, allowing you to use this model to create true realtime conversational agents.
