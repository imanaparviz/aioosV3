Additional resources

.

Install the plugin from PyPI:

uv

add

"livekit-agents[speechify]~=1.2"

Authentication

The Speechify plugin requires a

Speechify API key

.

Set

SPEECHIFY_API_KEY

in your .env file.

Usage

Use Speechify TTS within an AgentSession or as a standalone speech generator. For example, you can use this TTS in the

Voice AI quickstart

.

from

livekit

.

plugins

import

speechify

session

=

AgentSession

Parameters

This section describes some of the available parameters. See the

plugin reference

for a complete list of all available parameters.

voice_id

string

Required

Default:

jack

#

ID of the voice to be used for synthesizing speech. Refer to

list_voices()

method in the

plugin reference

.

model

string

Optional

#

ID of the model to use for generation. Use

simba-english

or

simba-multilingual

To learn more, see:

supported models

.

language

string

Optional

#

Language of input text in ISO-639-1 format. See the

supported languages

.

encoding

string

Optional

Default:

wav_48000

#

Audio encoding to use. Choose between

wav_48000

,

mp3_24000

,

ogg_24000

or

aac_24000

.

loudness_normalization

boolean

Optional

#

Determines whether to normalize the audio loudness to a standard level. When enabled, loudness normalization aligns the audio output to the following standards: Integrated loudness: -14 LUFS True peak: -2 dBTP Loudness range: 7 LU If disabled, the audio loudness will match the original loudness of the selected voice, which may vary significantly and be either too quiet or too loud. Enabling loudness normalization can increase latency due to additional processing required for audio level adjustments.

text_normalization

boolean

Optional

#

Determines whether to normalize the text. If enabled, it will transform numbers, dates, etc. into words. For example, "55" is normalized into "fifty five". This can increase latency due to additional processing required for text normalization.

Customizing pronunciation

Speechify supports custom pronunciation with Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), an XML-based markup language that gives you granular control over speech output. With SSML, you can leverage XML tags to craft audio content that delivers a more natural and engaging listening experience. To learn more, see

SSML
