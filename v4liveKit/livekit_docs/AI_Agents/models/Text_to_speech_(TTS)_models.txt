Overview

Voice agent speech is produced by a TTS model, configured with a voice profile that specifies tone, accent, and other qualitative characteristics of the speech. The TTS model runs on output from an

LLM

model to speak the agent response to the user.

You can choose a voice model served through LiveKit Inference or you can use a plugin to connect directly to a wider range of model providers with your own account.

LiveKit Inference

The following models are available in

LiveKit Inference

. Refer to the guide for each model for more details on additional configuration options. A limited selection of

Suggested voices

are available, as well as a wider selection through each provider's documentation.

Suggested voices

The following voices are good choices for overall quality and performance. Each provider has a much larger selection of voices to choose from, which you can find in their documentation. In addition to the voices below, you can choose to use other voices through LiveKit Inference.

Usage

To set up TTS in an

AgentSession

, provide a descriptor with both the desired model and voice. LiveKit Inference manages the connection to the model automatically. Consult the

Suggested voices

list for suggeted voices, or view the model reference for more voices.

Python

import

session

(

tts

,

# ... llm, stt, etc.

,

// ... llm, stt, etc.

}

)

Additional parameters

More configuration options, such as custom pronunciation, are available for each model. To set additional parameters, use the

TTS

class from the

inference

module. Consult each model reference for examples and available parameters.

Plugins

The LiveKit Agents framework also includes a variety of open source

plugins

for a wide range of TTS providers. Plugins are especially useful if you need custom voices, including voice cloning support. These plugins require authentication with the provider yourself, usually via an API key. You are responsible for setting up your own account and managing your own billing and credentials. The plugins are listed below, along with their availability for Python or Node.js.

Advanced features

The following sections cover more advanced topics common to all TTS providers. For more detailed reference on individual provider configuration, consult the model reference or plugin documentation for that provider.

Custom TTS

To create an entirely custom TTS, implement the

TTS node

in your agent.

Standalone usage

You can use a

TTS

instance as a standalone component by creating a stream. Use

push_text

to add text to the stream, and then consume a stream of

SynthesizedAudio

to publish as

realtime audio

to another participant.

Here is an example of a standalone TTS app:
