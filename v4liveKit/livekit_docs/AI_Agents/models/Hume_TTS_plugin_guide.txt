Parameters

This section describes some of the available parameters. See the

plugin reference

for a complete list of all available parameters.

voice

VoiceByName | VoiceById

Optional

#

The voice, specified by name or id, to be used. When no voice is specified, a novel voice will be

generated based on the text and optionally provided description

.

description

string

Optional

#

Natural language instructions describing how the synthesized speech should sound, including but not limited to tone, intonation, pacing, and accent. If a Voice is specified in the request, this description serves as

acting

instructions. If no Voice is specified, a new voice is generated

based on this description

.

speed

float

Optional

Default:

1.0

#

Adjusts the relative speaking rate on a non-linear scale from 0.25 (much slower) to 3.0 (much faster), where 1.0 represents normal speaking pace.

instant_mode

bool

Optional

Default:

true

#

Enables ultra-low latency streaming, reducing time to first chunk. Recommended for real-time applications. Only for streaming endpoints. With this enabled, requests incur 10% higher cost.

Instant mode is automatically enabled when a voice is specified in the request.

Updating utterance options

To change the values during the session, use the

update_options

method. It accepts the same parameters as the TTS constructor. The new values take effect on the next utterance:
