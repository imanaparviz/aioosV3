Note

If you're using LiveKit Cloud as your SIP server and you're signed in, your SIP URI is automatically

included in the code blocks where appropriate.

Use the following steps to configure inbound and outbound SIP trunks using

Twilio

.

Creating a SIP trunk for inbound and outbound calls

Create a Twilio SIP trunk for incoming or outgoing calls, or both, using the following steps.

To use the Twilio console, see

Configure a SIP trunk using the Twilio UI

.

Note

For inbound calls, you can use TwiML for Programmable Voice instead of setting up Elastic SIP Trunking. To learn more,

see

Inbound calls with Twilio Voice

.

Prerequisites

Purchase phone number

.

Install the Twilio CLI

.

Create a

Twilio profile

to use the CLI.

Step 1. Create a SIP trunk

The domain name for your SIP trunk  must end in

pstn.twilio.com

. For example to create a trunk named

My test trunk

with the domain name

my-test-trunk.pstn.twilio.com

, run the following command:

twilio api trunking v1 trunks create

\

--friendly-name

"My test trunk"

\

--domain-name

"my-test-trunk.pstn.twilio.com"

The output includes the trunk SID. Copy it for use in the following steps.

Step 2: Configure your trunk

Configure the trunk for inbound calls or outbound calls or both. To create a SIP trunk for both inbound and

outbound calls, follow the steps in both tabs:

Inbound

Outbound

For inbound trunks, configure an

origination URI

. If you're

using LiveKit Cloud and are signed in, your SIP URI is automatically included in the following command:

twilio api trunking v1 trunks origination-urls create

\

--trunk-sid

<

twilio_trunk_sid

>

\

--friendly-name

"LiveKit SIP URI"

\

--sip-url

"sip:<your SIP endpoint>"

\

--weight

1

--priority

1

--enabled

Region-based endpoints

To restrict calls to a specific region, replace your global LiveKit SIP endpoint with a

region-based endpoint

.

For outbound trunks, configure username and password authentication using a credentials list.

Complete the following steps using the Twilio console.

Step 1: Create a credential list

Sign in to the

Twilio console

.

Select

Voice

»

Credential lists

.

Create a new credential list with the username and password of your choice.

Step 2: Associate the credential list with your SIP trunk

Select

Elastic SIP Trunking

»

Manage

»

Trunks

and select the outbound trunk created in the

previous steps.

Select

Termination

»

Authentication

»

Credential Lists

and select the credential list you

just created.

Select

Save

.

Step 3: Associate phone number and trunk

The Twilio trunk SID and phone number SID are included in the output of

previous steps. If you didn't copy the SIDs, you can list them using the following commands:

To list phone numbers:

twilio phone-numbers list

To list trunks:

twilio api trunking v1 trunks list

twilio api trunking v1 trunks phone-numbers create

\

--trunk-sid

<

twilio_trunk_sid

>

\

--phone-number-sid

<

twilio_phone_number_sid

>

Configure a SIP trunk using the Twilio UI

Sign in to the

Twilio console

.

Purchase a phone number

.

Create SIP Trunk

on Twilio:

Select

Elastic SIP Trunking

»

Manage

»

Trunks

.

Create a SIP trunk.

Tip

Using your Twilio API key, you can skip the next two steps by using

this snippet

to set your origination and termination URLs automatically.

For inbound calls:

Navigate to

Voice

»

Manage

»

Origination connection policy

, and create an

Origination Connection Policy

Select the policy you just created and set the

Origination SIP URI

to your LiveKit SIP URI (available on your

Project settings

page). For example,

sip:vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud

.

Region-based endpoints

To restrict calls to a specific region, replace your global LiveKit SIP endpoint with a

region-based endpoint

.

For outbound calls, configure termination and authentication:

Navigate to

Elastic SIP Trunking

»

Manage

»

Trunks

.

Copy the

Termination SIP URI

to use

when you create an

outbound trunk

for LiveKit.

Configure

Authentication

:

Select

Elastic SIP Trunking

»

Manage

»

Credential lists

and create a new credential list

with a username and password of your choice.

Associate your trunk with the credential list:

Select

Elastic SIP Trunking

»

Manage

»

Trunks

and select the outbound trunk created in the

previous steps.

Select

Termination

» *

Authentication

»

Credential Lists

and select the credential list you

just created.

Next steps

Head back to the main setup documentation to finish connecting your SIP trunk to LiveKit.
