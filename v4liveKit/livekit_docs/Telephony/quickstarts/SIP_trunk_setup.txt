Overview

LiveKit is compatible with any SIP trunking provider. This guide provides general instructions for setting up a SIP trunk with an external provider and then associating it with your LiveKit Cloud project.

External provider setup

The usual steps to create a SIP trunk are as follows:

Create a SIP trunk with your provider.

Add authentication or limit trunk usage by phone numbers or IP addresses.

Purchase a phone number and associate it with your SIP trunk.

Add your

LiveKit SIP endpoint

to the SIP trunk.

SIP endpoint

Depending on your SIP trunking provider, you might need to use a

SIP endpoint

to configure inbound calls instead of your SIP URI. The SIP endpoint is your LiveKit SIP URI without the

sip:

prefix. You can find your SIP URI on the

Project settings

page.

For example, if your SIP URI is

sip:vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud

, your SIP endpoint is

vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud

.

Region-based endpoints

To restrict calls to a specific region, replace your global LiveKit SIP endpoint with a

region-based endpoint

.

Provider-specific instructions

LiveKit setup

Now you are ready to configure your LiveKit Cloud project to use the SIP trunk.

The following steps are common to all SIP trunking providers.

LiveKit CLI

These examples use the

LiveKit Cloud

. For additional examples and full documentation, see the linked documentation for each component.

Inbound trunk setup

An

inbound trunk

allows you to accept incoming phone calls.

Create an inbound trunk using the LiveKit Cloud dashboard.

Sign in to the

Telephony

→

Configuration

page.

Select

Create new

→

Trunk

.

Select the

JSON editor

tab.

Select

Inbound

for

Trunk direction

.

Copy and paste the following text into the editor, replacing the phone number with the number you purchased from your SIP trunk provider:

{

"name"

:

"My inbound trunk"

,

"numbers"

:

[

"+15105550123"

]

}

Select

Create

.

Create a dispatch rule

You must set up at least one

dispatch rule

to accept incoming calls into a LiveKit room.

This example creates a dispatch rule that puts each caller into a randomly generated unique room using the name prefix

call-

. For many applications, this is the only configuration you need.

Sign to the

Telephony

→

Configuration

page.

Select

Create new

→

Dispatch rule

.

Select the

JSON editor

tab.

Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

{

"name"

:

"My dispatch rule"

,

"rule"

:

{

"dispatchRuleIndividual"

:

{

"roomPrefix"

:

"call-"

}

}

}

Select

Create

.

After you create an inbound trunk and dispatch rule, you can create an agent to answer incoming calls. To learn more, see the resources in the

Next steps

section.

Create an outbound trunk

Create an

outbound trunk

to make outgoing phone calls with LiveKit.

This example creates an username and password authenticated outbound trunk with the phone number

+15105550123

and the trunk domain name

my-trunk-domain-name

.

Sign in to the

Telephony

→

Configuration

page.

Select

Create new

→

Trunk

.

Select the

JSON editor

tab.

Select

Outbound

for

Trunk direction

.

Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

{

"name"

:

"My outbound trunk"

,

"address"

:

"<my-trunk-domain-name>"

,

"numbers"

:

[

"+15105550123"

]

,

"authUsername"

:

"<username>"

,

"authPassword"

:

"<password>"

}

Select

Create

.

Now you are ready to

place outgoing calls

.
