Prerequisites

The following are required to complete the steps in this guide:

A

Wavix account

account.

A

purchased phone number

from Wavix.

A project on

LiveKit Cloud

.

Accepting inbound calls

Complete the following steps to accept inbound calls with Wavix and LiveKit.

Step 1: Configure inbound call routing in Wavix

To receive calls with Wavix and LiveKit, you need to set up inbound call routing.

For this step, you need your LiveKit

SIP endpoint

. This is your LiveKit SIP URI without the

sip:

prefix. You can find your SIP URI on your

Project settings

page.

Sign in to your

Wavix account

.

Select

Numbers & trunks

→

My numbers

.

Select the more (

⋮

) menu and choose

Edit number

.

For

Destination

→

Configure inbound call routing

, select

SIP URI

.

Enter the destination in the format:

[did]@[LiveKit SIP endpoint]

, for example:

[did]@vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud

.

Note

The

[did]

placeholder in the destination string is automatically replaced with your Wavix phone number.

Select

Save

.

Step 2: Create an inbound trunk in LiveKit

An

inbound trunk

allows you to accept incoming phone calls to your Wavix phone number. To create an inbound trunk in LiveKit, use the following steps:

Sign in to

LiveKit Cloud

.

Select

Telephony

→

Configuration

.

Select the

+Create new

button →

Trunk

.

For

Trunk direction

, select

Inbound

.

Enter a comma-separated list of Wavix numbers to associate with the trunk.

Select

Create

.

Step 3: Create a dispatch rule in LiveKit

In addition to an inbound trunk, you need a

dispatch rule

to determine how callers are dispatched to LiveKit rooms.

Create a dispatch rule using the following steps:

Navigate to the

Telephony

→

Configuration

page.

Select the

+Create new

button →

Dispatch rule

.

Complete the

Rule name

and

Room name

fields.

Select

Match trunks

and select the inbound trunk you created in the previous step.

Additional options

Selecting trunks to match a dispatch rule is optional. By default, a dispatch rule applies to all inbound calls for your LiveKit project.

The default

Rule type

is

Direct

. This means all callers are placed in the same room. For alternative rule types, see

SIP dispatch rule

.

Test inbound calls

After you complete the setup steps, start a voice AI agent and call your Wavix phone number. Your agent should answer the call. If you don't have an agent, see the

Voice AI quickstart

to create one.

Making outbound calls

Complete the following steps to make outbound calls using LiveKit and Wavix.

Step 1: Create a SIP trunk in Wavix

Create a Wavix SIP trunk for outgoing calls, using the following steps.

Sign in to your

Wavix account

.

Navigate to

Numbers & Trunks

→

Trunks

.

Select the

Create new

button.

Enter a

SIP trunk name

.

In the

Caller ID

section, select one of the phone numbers you purchased.

Under

Authentication Method

, select

Digest

and complete the

Password

fields.

Select

Next

.

Optionally, configure additional limits:

Max outbound call duration

Max number of simultaneous calls via the SIP trunk

Max call cost

Select

Save

.

After the SIP trunk is successfully created, it appears in your account's SIP trunks list. Note the 5-digit SIP trunk ID that is generated automatically. Your SIP trunk ID is needed for the next step when you create an outbound trunk in LiveKit.

Step 2: Configure outbound calls

For outbound calls, you need to create an outbound trunk in LiveKit using the Wavix SIP trunk credentials:

Sign in to

LiveKit Cloud

.

Select

Telephony

→

Configuration

.

Select the

+ Create new

button →

Trunk

.

For

Trunk direction

, select

Outbound

.

Configure the outbound trunk with the following settings:

Address

: Use the Wavix SIP gateway (e.g.,

<country-code>.wavix.net

)

Numbers

: Enter your Wavix phone number.

Select

Optional settings

and complete the following fields:

Username

: Your 5-digit SIP trunk ID from Wavix.

Password

: The SIP trunk password you set in Wavix.

Select

Create

.

Tip

Choose the primary gateway closest to your location. A full list of Wavix regional gateways is available at the bottom of your

Wavix trunks page

.

Transfer calls

Wavix supports cold call transfers using the SIP REFER command. To transfer a call, you need two Wavix numbers—one for the incoming call and one to transfer calls to.

To transfer an active LiveKit call, use the

TransferSIPParticipant

server API. The following is a Node.js example. To learn more and for additional examples, see

Call forwarding

.

import

{

SipClient

}

from

'livekit-server-sdk'

;

async

function

transferParticipant

(

participant

)

{

console

.

log

(

"transfer participant initiated"

)

;

const

sipTransferOptions

=

{

playDialtone

:

false

}

;

const

sipClient

=

new

SipClient

(

process

.

env

.

LIVEKIT_URL

,

process

.

env

.

LIVEKIT_API_KEY

,

process

.

env

.

LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

)

;

const

transferTo

=

"sip:+19495550100@us.wavix.net"

;

await

sipClient

.

transferSipParticipant

(

'open-room'

,

participant

.

identity

,

transferTo

,

sipTransferOptions

)

;

console

.

log

(

'transfer participant'

)

;

}

Replace the

transferTo

value with your Wavix number using the format:

sip:+[YOUR_WAVIX_NUMBER]@[WAVIX_SIP_GATEWAY]

.

Enable call encryption

You can choose to encrypt call media for enhanced security. Contact Wavix support to enable encryption for your Wavix numbers or trunks. After enabling encryption, see

Secure trunking

to configure encryption for LiveKit trunks.

Troubleshooting outbound calls

The following tables lists common issues with outbound calls.

Issue

Cause

603 Declined response

This might occur when calling a destination with a per-minute rate higher than the Max call rate set for your account. Contact Wavix support to request a change to your max call rate.

Registration issues

Check the registration status of your SIP trunk.

Wrong number format

Make sure you dial the full international number (

E.164

format): For example,

+19085550100

(US),

+44946001218

(UK). Strip prefixes like

0

,

00

, or

011

before the dialed number.
