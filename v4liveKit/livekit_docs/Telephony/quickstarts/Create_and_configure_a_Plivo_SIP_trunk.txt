Connect

Plivo's

SIP trunking with LiveKit for inbound and outbound calls.

Prerequisites

The following are required to complete the steps in this guide:

Plivo account

LiveKit Cloud project

Inbound calling

To accept inbound calls with Plivo and LiveKit, complete the steps in the following sections.

Create a SIP trunk

Create an inbound trunk in Plivo, setting your LiveKit SIP endpoint as the primary URI.

Sign in to the

Plivo Console

.

Navigate to

Zentrunk

→

Inbound Trunks

.

Select

Create New Inbound Trunk

and provide a descriptive name for your trunk.

For

Primary URI

, select

Add New URI

and enter your LiveKit

SIP endpoint

. Include

;transport=tcp

in the URI. For example,

vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud;transport=tcp

.

If you're signed in to LiveKit Cloud, your SIP endpoint is automatically included in the following example:

<

your SIP subdomain

>

.sip.livekit.cloud

;

transport

=

tcp

Secure trunking

If you're setting up

secure trunking

, use

;transport=tls

instead of

;transport=tcp

.

Select

Create Trunk

.

Connect your phone number

Connect your Plivo phone number to the inbound trunk.

Navigate to

Phone Numbers

→

Your Numbers

.

Select the phone number to connect to the trunk.

In the

Number Configuration

section →

Application Type

, select

Zentrunk

.

For

Trunk

, select the trunk you created in the previous step.

Select

Update

.

Configure LiveKit to accept calls

Set up an

inbound trunk

and

dispatch rule

in LiveKit to accepts calls to your Plivo phone number.

Test incoming calls

Start your LiveKit agent and call your Plivo phone number. Your agent should answer the call. If you don't have an agent, see the

Voice AI quickstart

to create one.

Troubleshooting

For help troubleshooting inbound calls, check the following logs:

First check the

Plivo logs

.

Then check the

call logs

in your LiveKit Cloud dashboard.

Outbound calling

To make outbound calls with LiveKit and Plivo and LiveKit, complete the steps in the following sections.

Create an outbound trunk in Plivo

Set up an outbound trunk with username and password authentication in Plivo.

Sign in to the

Plivo Console

.

Navigate to

Zentrunk

→

Outbound Trunks

.

Select

Create New Outbound Trunk

and provide a descriptive name for your trunk.

In the

Trunk Authentication

section →

Credentials List

, select

Add New Credentials List

.

Add a username and strong password for outbound call authentication. Make sure these values match the username and password you use for your LiveKit outbound trunk.

For

Secure Trunking

, select

Enabled

(recommended).

Secure trunking

If you enable secure trunking in Plivo, you must also enable secure trunking in LiveKit. To learn more, see

Secure trunking

.

Select

Create Trunk

to complete your outbound trunk configuration.

Copy the

Termination SIP Domain

for the next step.

Configure LiveKit to make outbound calls

Create an

outbound trunk

in LiveKit using the

Termination SIP Domain

, and username and password from the previous section.

Place an outbound call

Test your configuration by placing an outbound call with LiveKit using the

CreateSIPParticipant

API. To learn more, see

Creating a SIP participant

.

Troubleshooting

If the call fails to connect, check the following common issues:

Verify your SIP URI. It must include

;transport=tcp

.

Verify your Plivo phone number is associated with the correct trunk.

For outbound calls, check the following logs:

First check the

call logs

in your LiveKit Cloud dashboard.

Then check the

Plivo logs

.

For error codes, see the

Plivo hangup codes

reference.

Regional restrictions

If your calls are made from a Plivo India phone number, or you're dialing numbers in India, you must enable

region pinning

for your LiveKit project. This restricts calls to India to comply with local telephony regulations. Your calls will fail to connect if region pinning is not enabled.

For other countries, select the region closest to the location of your call traffic for optimal performance.
