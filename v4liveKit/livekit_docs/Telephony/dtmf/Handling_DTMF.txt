LiveKit's Telephony stack fully supports DTMF tones, enabling integration

with legacy IVR systems. It also enables agents to receive DTMF tones from telephone users.

Sending DTMF

To send DTMF tones, use the

publishDtmf

API on the

localParticipant

.

This API transmits DTMF tones to the room; tones can be sent by any participant in the room.

SIP participants in the room receive the tones and relay them to the telephone user.

Tip

Sending DTMF tones requires both a numeric code and a string representation to

ensure compatibility with various SIP implementations.

Special characters like

*

and

#

are mapped to their respective numeric codes.

See

RFC 4733

for details.

Receiving DTMF

When SIP receives DTMF tones, they are relayed to the room as events that participants can listen for.
