Introduction

LiveKit SIP bridges the gap between traditional telephony and modern digital communication.

It enables seamless interaction between traditional phone systems and LiveKit rooms. You can use

LiveKit SIP to accept calls and make calls. When you add LiveKit Agents, you can use an AI voice

agent to handle your inbound and outbound calls.

Concepts

LiveKit SIP extends the

core primitives

—participant, room,

and track—to include two additional concepts specific to SIP: trunks and dispatch rules.

These concepts are represented by objects created through the

API

and control how calls are handled.

SIP participant

Each caller, callee, and AI voice agent that participates in a call is a LiveKit participant. A SIP participant is like any other participant and can be managed using the

participant APIs

. They have the same

attributes and metadata

as any other participant, and have additional

SIP specific attributes

.

For inbound calls, a SIP participant is automatically created for each caller.

To make an outbound call, you create a SIP participant using the

CreateSIPParticipant

API to make the call.

Trunks

LiveKit SIP trunks bridge your SIP provider and LiveKit. To use LiveKit, you must configure a SIP trunk with your telephony provider. The setup depends on your use case—whether you're handling incoming calls, making outgoing calls, or both.

Inbound trunks

handle incoming calls and can be restricted to specific IP addresses or phone numbers.

Outbound trunks

are used to place outgoing calls.

Trunks can be region restricted to meet local telephony regulations.

Note

The same SIP provider trunk can be associated with both an inbound and an outbound trunk in LiveKit.

You only need to create an inbound or outbound trunk

once

.

Dispatch rules

Dispatch Rules

are associated with a specific trunk and control how inbound calls are

dispatched to LiveKit rooms. All callers can be placed in the same room or different rooms based on the dispatch

rules. Multiple dispatch rules can be associated with the same trunk as long as each rule has a different pin.

Dispatch rules can also be used to add custom participant attributes to

SIP participants

.

Service architecture

LiveKit SIP relies on the following services:

SIP trunking provider for your phone number. LiveKit SIP supports most SIP providers out of the box.

LiveKit server (part of LiveKit Cloud) for API requests, managing and verifying SIP trunks and

dispatch rules, and creating participants and rooms for calls.

LiveKit SIP (part of LiveKit Cloud) to respond to SIP requests, mediate trunk authentication, and

match dispatch rules.

If you use LiveKit Cloud, LiveKit SIP is ready to use with your project without any

additional configuration. If you're self hosting LiveKit, the SIP service needs to be deployed

separately. To learn more about self hosting, see

SIP server

.

Using LiveKit SIP

The LiveKit SIP SDK is available in multiple languages. To learn more, see

SIP API

.

LiveKit SIP has been tested with the following SIP providers:

Note

LiveKit SIP is designed to work with all SIP providers. However, compatibility testing is

limited to the providers below.

Twilio

Telnyx

Exotel

Plivo

Wavix

SIP features

LiveKit SIP supports the following functionality.

Feature

Description

DTMF

You can configure DTMF when making outbound calls by adding them to the

CreateSIPParticipant

request.

To learn more, see

Making a call with extension codes (DTMF)

.

SIP REFER

You can transfer calls using the

TransferSIPParticipant

API. Calls can be transferred to any valid

telephone number or SIP URI. To learn more, see

Cold transfer

and

Warm transfer

.

SIP headers

You can map custom

X-*

SIP headers to participant attributes. For example, custom headers can be used

to route calls to different workflows. To learn more, see

Custom attributes

.

Noise cancellation

You can enable noise cancellation for callers and callees using Krisp. To learn more,

see

Noise cancellation for calls

.

Region pinning

You can restrict incoming and outgoing calls to a specific region to comply with local telephony regulations. To learn more, see

Region pinning for SIP

.

Secure trunking

You can enable encryption for signaling traffic and media using TLS and SRTP for SIP calls. To learn more, see

Secure trunking

.

Supported protocols

LiveKit SIP supports the following protocols:

Protocol

Description

TCP, UDP, TLS

Transport protocols for SIP signaling.

RTP, SRTP

Network protocols for delivering audio and video media.

Noise cancellation for calls

Krisp

noise cancellation uses AI models to identify and remove background noise in realtime. This improves

the quality of calls that occur in noisy environments. For LiveKit SIP applications that use agents, noise cancellation improves the

quality and clarity of user speech for turn detection, transcriptions, and recordings.

For incoming calls, see the

inbound trunks documentation

for the

krisp_enabled

attribute.

For outgoing calls, see the

CreateSIPParticipant

documentation for the

krisp_enabled

attribute used during

outbound call creation

.
