Outbound call workflow

To make an outbound call, you create a

SIP participant

with the user's phone

number. When you execute the

CreateSIPParticipant

request, LiveKit SIP sends an INVITE request to

your SIP provider. If the SIP provider accepts the call, the SIP participant is added to the

LiveKit room.

Call the

CreateSIPParticipant

API to create a SIP participant.

LiveKit SIP sends an INVITE request to the SIP trunking provider.

SIP trunking provider validates trunk credentials and accepts the call.

LiveKit server places SIP participant in the LiveKit room specified in the

CreateSIPParticipant

request.

Setup for making calls

The following sections outline the steps required to make an outbound SIP call.

SIP trunking provider setup

Purchase a phone number from a SIP Provider.

For a list of tested providers, see the table in

Using LiveKit SIP

.

Configure the SIP Trunk on the provider to send SIP traffic to accept SIP traffic from the

LiveKit SIP service.

For instructions for setting up a SIP trunk,

see

Configuring a SIP provider trunk

.

LiveKit SIP configuration

Create an

outbound trunk

associated with your SIP provider phone number.

This is the number that is used to dial out to the user. Include the authentication credentials

required by your SIP trunking provider to make calls.

Make an outbound call

Create a SIP participant. When the

CreateSIPParticipant

request is executed, a SIP call is initiated:

An INVITE request is sent to the SIP trunk provider. The provider checks authentication credentials

and returns a response to LiveKit.

If the call is accepted, LiveKit dials the user and creates a SIP participant in the LiveKit room.

If the call is not accepted by the SIP trunk provider, the

CreateSIPParticipant

request fails.

After the call starts ringing, you can check the call status by listening to

participant events

:

If the

sip.callStatus

participant attribute is updated to

active

, the call has connected.

If the call fails, the participant is disconnected and leaves the room.
