LiveKit SIP supports secure trunking using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt signaling traffic, and Secure Real-time Transport (SRTP) to encrypt media traffic. Encryption ensures that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a eavesdropping attacker (man-in-the-middle) cannot listen in on the conversation.

SIP REFER is not supported when using TLS.

Transferring calls with SIP REFER is not currently supported over TLS.

Configure secure trunking for SIP calls

Setting up secure trunking requires multiple steps and includes enabling SRTP and TLS on your SIP trunking provider side, and enabling media encryption on your LiveKit trunks or on a per-call basis. The following sections provide instructions for enabling secure trunking with Twilio and Telnyx and setting up your LiveKit SIP trunks.

To secure calls you must complete all of the following steps:

Enable secure trunking with your SIP trunking provider.

Update your SIP URIs to use TLS for transport.

Enable media encryption for your LiveKit SIP trunks.

Prerequisites

The following instructions assume you have already configured trunking with your SIP provider. If you haven't, see the

SIP trunk setup

quickstart or select your provider-specific instructions from the navigation menu.

Step 1: Enable secure trunking with your SIP trunking provider

Depending on your SIP trunking provider, you might need to explicitly enable secure trunking.

Enable secure trunking with Twilio and Telnyx

Twilio

Telnyx

Sign in to the

Twilio Console

.

Select

Develop

tab →

Elastic SIP Trunking

→

Trunks

.

Select the trunk you want to edit.

On the

General Settings

page, under

Secure Trunking

.

Save your changes.

Sign in to the

Telnyx Portal

.

Select

Real-Time Communications

→

Voice

SIP Trunking

.

Select the trunk you want to edit.

Select the

Inbound

tab.

For

SIP transport protocol

, select

TLS

.

For

Encrypted media

, select

SRTP

.

Save your changes.

Enable secure trunking for other providers

If you're using a different provider, check with them to see if you need to enable secure trunking.

Step 2: Update your SIP URIs to use TLS

Enable TLS to encrypt signaling traffic.

Update the origination URI in Telnyx or Twilio

The following instructions apply to inbound calls for Twilio or Telnyx.

Twilio

Telnyx

Sign in to the

Twilio Console

.

Select the

Develop

tab →

Elastic SIP Trunking

→

Manage

→

Trunks

.

Select the trunk you want to edit →

Origination

.

Update the

Origination URI

to include

;transport=tls

.

Save your changes.

Sign in to the

Telnyx Portal

.

Select

Real-Time Communications

→

Voice

→

SIP Trunking

.

Select the edit icon for your trunk →

Inbound settings

.

Select

Authentication and routing

.

In the

FQDN

section, select

Add FQDN

.

Add your SIP domain and port

5061

for TLS and save.

In the

Inbound calls routing

section, select the option you just added with port

5061

.

Save your changes.

Update the origination URI for other providers

For other providers, set the origination URI to your SIP URI with

;transport=tls

appended to it. For example, if your SIP URI is:

sip:bwwn08a2m4o.sip.livekit.cloud

Set the origination URI to:

sip:bwwn08a2m4o.sip.livekit.cloud;transport=tls

.

You can find your SIP URI on your LiveKit Cloud

project settings

page.

If your provider doesn't support a SIP URI with URI parameters, you must enable TLS another way:

Enable TLS in the trunk settings (required).

If supported, set the port to

5061

, the default port for SIP over TLS.

TLS must be enabled

Changing only the port number without enabling TLS is not enough. Some providers might treat port

5061

as a non-standard port for insecure UDP or TCP traffic.

Check your provider's documentation for exact steps.

Step 3: Enable media encryption for your SIP trunks

Set the

media_encryption

parameter for your inbound or outbound trunks to either allow or require encryption. Valid values are as follows:

SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_ALLOW

: Use media encryption if available.

SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_REQUIRE

: Require media encryption.

By default, media encryption is turned off. To see all options, see the

API reference

.

Create an inbound trunk

Create an inbound trunk with media encryption enabled. To edit a trunk instead, see

Edit an existing trunk

.

Sign in to your

Telephony configuration

dashboard.

Select

Create new

→

Trunk

.

Select the

JSON editor

tab and copy and paste the following contents. Replace the phone number with the one purchased from your SIP trunking provider.

{

"name"

:

"My trunk"

,

"numbers"

:

[

"+15105550100"

]

,

"krispEnabled"

:

true

,

"mediaEncryption"

:

"SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_ALLOW"

}

Select

Create

.

Create an outbound trunk

For outbound calls, create an outbound trunk with media encryption enabled and

transport

protocol set to

SIP_TRANSPORT_TLS

. All calls made using this trunk use TLS and SRTP.

You can also enable media encryption on a

call-by-call basis

by setting the

media_encryption

parameter in the

CreateSIPParticipant

request. However, you should still enable TLS for calls on the outbound trunk.

Use the following instructions to create a new wildcard outbound trunk with SRTP and TLSenabled. The wildcard allows all calls to be routed to the same trunk. To edit a trunk instead, see

Edit an existing trunk

.

Sign in to your

Telephony configuration

dashboard.

Select

Create new

→

Trunk

.

Select the

JSON editor

→ select

Outbound

for

Trunk direction

.

Copy and paste the following contents. Replace the SIP trunking provider endpoint, and username and password for authentication.

{

"name"

:

"My outbound trunk"

,

"address"

:

"<sip-trunking-provider-endpoint>"

,

"transport"

:

"SIP_TRANSPORT_TLS"

,

"numbers"

:

[

"*"

]

,

"authUsername"

:

"<username>"

,

"authPassword"

:

"<password>"

,

"mediaEncryption"

:

"SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_ALLOW"

}

Select

Create

.

Edit an existing trunk

Edit an existing inbound or outbound trunk to enable media encryption using the LiveKit Cloud dashboard.

Sign in to your

Telephony configuration

dashboard.

Navigate to the

Inbound

or

Outbound

section on the page.

Select the more menu (

⋮

) next to the trunk you want to edit →

Configure trunk

.

For

outbound

trunks, for

Transport

select

TLS

.

Expand the

Optional settings

section. Select either

Media encryption enabled

or

Media encryption required

.

Select

Update

.

Enable media encryption per call

You can enable media encryption on a per-call basis by setting the

media_encryption

parameter in the

CreateSIPParticipant

request. Valid values are as follows:

SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_ALLOW

: Use media encryption if available.

SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_REQUIRE

: Require media encryption.

SRTP must be enabled

You must also enable SRTP on the SIP trunking provider side. If you haven't already enabled this, see

Step 1: Enable secure trunking with your SIP trunking provider

.

Create a

sip-participant.json

file with the following participant details:

{

"sip_trunk_id"

:

"<your-outbound-trunk-id>"

,

"sip_call_to"

:

"<phone-number-to-dial>"

,

"room_name"

:

"my-sip-room"

,

"participant_identity"

:

"sip-test"

,

"participant_name"

:

"Test Caller"

,

"krisp_enabled"

:

true

,

"wait_until_answered"

:

true

,

"media_encryption"

:

"SIP_MEDIA_ENCRYPT_ALLOW"

}

Create the SIP Participant using the CLI. After you run this command, a call is made to the

<phone-number-to-dial>

number from the number configured in your outbound trunk.

lk sip participant create sip-participant.json
