Note

Before starting, make sure you have created a LiveKit Cloud account,

installed the LiveKit CLI

, and have authenticated or manually configured your LiveKit Cloud project of choice.

The LiveKit CLI can help you bootstrap applications from a number of convenient template repositories, using your project credentials to set up required environment variables and other configuration automatically. To create an application from a template, run the following:

lk app create

--template

<

template_name

>

my-app

Then follow the CLI prompts to finish your setup.

The

--template

flag may be omitted to see a list of all available templates, or can be chosen from a selection of our first-party templates:
