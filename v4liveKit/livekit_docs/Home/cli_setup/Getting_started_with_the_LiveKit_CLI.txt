Set up the CLI

lk

is LiveKit's suite of CLI utilities. It lets you conveniently access server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic all from your command line.

Install the CLI

Install the CLI using the relevant command below.

macOS

Linux

Windows

From Source

Install the LiveKit CLI with

Homebrew

:

brew install livekit-cli

curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash

Tip

You can also download the latest precompiled binaries

Update the CLI

Updating the CLI regularly is recommended to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.

macOS

Before updating, make sure you've recently pulled the latest changes from

Add a project

You must link a LiveKit project to the LiveKit CLI to use it. This can be a project with LiveKit Cloud or a self-hosted LiveKit server instance.

To link a LiveKit Cloud project, run the following command then follow the instructions in your browser to authenticate.

lk cloud auth

To add a different project, see the

Project management

guide.

Tip

If you're looking to explore LiveKit's

Agents

framework, or want to prototype your app against a prebuilt frontend or token server, check out

Sandboxes

.

Generate access token

A participant creating or joining a LiveKit

room

needs an

access token

to do so. For now, let’s generate one via CLI:

Cloud

Localhost

lk token create

\

--api-key devkey --api-secret secret

\

--join

--room

test_room

--identity

test_user

\

--valid-for 24h

Tip

Make sure you're running LiveKit server locally in

dev mode

.

lk token create

\

--api-key

<

PROJECT_KEY

>

--api-secret

<

PROJECT_SECRET

>

\

--join

--room

test_room

--identity

test_user

\

--valid-for 24h

Alternatively, you can

generate tokens from your project's dashboard

.

Test with LiveKit Meet

Tip

If you're testing a LiveKit Cloud instance, you can find your

Project URL

(it starts with

wss://

) in the project settings.

Use a sample app,

LiveKit Meet

, to preview your new LiveKit instance. Enter the token you

previously generated

in the "Custom" tab. Once connected, your microphone and camera will be streamed in realtime to your new LiveKit instance (and any other participant who connects to the same room)!

If interested, here's the

full source

for this example app.

Simulating another publisher

One way to test a multi-user session is by

generating

a second token (ensure

--identity

is unique), opening our example app in another

browser tab

and connecting to the same room.

Another way is to use the CLI as a simulated participant and publish a prerecorded video to the room. Here's how:

Cloud

Localhost

lk room

join

\

--url

ws://localhost:7880

\

--api-key devkey --api-secret secret

\

--publish-demo

--identity

bot_user

\

my_first_room

lk room

join

\

--url

<

PROJECT_SECURE_WEBSOCKET_ADDRESS

>

\

--api-key

<

PROJECT_API_KEY

>

--api-secret

<

PROJECT_SECRET_KEY

>

\

--publish-demo

--identity

bot_user

\

my_first_room

This command publishes a looped demo video to

my-first-room

. Due to how the file was encoded, expect a short delay before your browser has sufficient data to render frames.
