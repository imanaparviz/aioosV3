Getting started guide

This guide uses the Swift Components library for the easiest way to get started on iOS.

LiveKit also supports macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. More documentation for the core Swift SDK is

on GitHub

.

Otherwise follow this guide to build your first LiveKit app with SwiftUI.

SDK installation

Package.swift

Xcode

Go to

Project Settings

>

Package Dependencies

.

Add a new package and enter the URL:

https://github.com/livekit/components-swift

.

See

Adding package dependencies to your app

for more details.

Permissions and entitlements

You must add privacy strings for both camera and microphone usage to your

Info.plist

file, even if you don't plan to use both in your app.

<

dict

>

...

<

key

>

NSCameraUsageDescription

</

key

>

<

string

>

$(PRODUCT_NAME) uses your camera

</

string

>

<

key

>

NSMicrophoneUsageDescription

</

key

>

<

string

>

$(PRODUCT_NAME) uses your microphone

</

string

>

...

</

dict

>

To continue audio sessions in the background add the

Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture

background mode to the Capabilities tab of your app target in Xcode.

Your

Info.plist

should have the following entries:

<

dict

>

...

<

key

>

UIBackgroundModes

</

key

<

string

>

audio

</

string

>

</

array

Connecting to LiveKit

This simple example uses a hardcoded token that expires in 2 hours. In a real app, you’ll need to

generate a token

with your server.

ContentView.swift

// !! Note !!

// This sample hardcodes a token which expires in 2 hours.

let

wsURL

=

"<your LiveKit server URL>"

let

token

=

"<generate a token>"

// In production you should generate tokens on your server, and your client

// should request a token from your server.
