livekit-examples/agent-starter-android

Getting started guide

This guide uses the Android Components library for the easiest way to get started on Android.

If you are using the traditional view-based system, check out the

Android quickstart

.

Otherwise follow this guide to build your first LiveKit app with Android Compose.

SDK installation

LiveKit Components for Android Compose is available as a Maven package.

...

dependencies {

implementation "io.livekit:livekit-android-compose-components:<current version>"

}

See the

releases page

for information on the latest version of the SDK.

You'll also need JitPack as one of your repositories. In your

settings.gradle

file:

dependencyResolutionManagement {

repositories {

google()

mavenCentral()

//...

maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }

}

}

Permissions

LiveKit relies on the

RECORD_AUDIO

and

CAMERA

permissions to use the microphone and camera.

These permission must be requested at runtime, like so:

/**

* Checks if the RECORD_AUDIO and CAMERA permissions are granted.

*

* If not granted, will request them. Will call onPermissionGranted if/when

* the permissions are granted.

*/
