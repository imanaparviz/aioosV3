livekit-examples/agent-starter-android

Getting started guide

This guide is for Android apps using the traditional view-based system. If you are using Jetpack Compose, check out the

Compose quickstart guide

.

Install LiveKit SDK

LiveKit for Android is available as a Maven package.

...

dependencies {

implementation "io.livekit:livekit-android:<current version>"

}

See the

releases page

for information on the latest version of the SDK.

You'll also need JitPack as one of your repositories. In your

settings.gradle

file:

dependencyResolutionManagement {

repositories {

google()

mavenCentral()

//...

maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }

}

}

Permissions

LiveKit relies on the

RECORD_AUDIO

and

CAMERA

permissions to use the microphone and camera.

These permission must be requested at runtime, like so:

private

fun

requestPermissions

(

)

{

val

requestPermissionLauncher

=

registerForActivityResult

(

ActivityResultContracts

.

RequestMultiplePermissions

(

)

)

{

grants

->

for

(

grant

in

grants

.

entries

)

{

if

(

!

grant

.

value

)

{

Toast

.

makeText

(

this

,

"Missing permission:

${

grant

.

key

}

"

,

Toast

.

LENGTH_SHORT

)

.

show

(

)

}

}

}

val

neededPermissions

=

listOf

(

Manifest

.

permission

.

RECORD_AUDIO

,

Manifest

.

permission

.

CAMERA

)

.

filter

{

ContextCompat

.

checkSelfPermission

(

this

,

it

)

==

PackageManager

.

PERMISSION_DENIED

}

.

toTypedArray

(

)

if

(

neededPermissions

.

isNotEmpty

(

)

)

{

requestPermissionLauncher

.

launch

(

neededPermissions

)

}

}

Connect to LiveKit

Use the following code to connect and publish audio/video to a room, while rendering the video from other connected participants.

LiveKit uses

SurfaceViewRenderer

to render video tracks. A

TextureView

implementation is also

provided through

TextureViewRenderer

. Subscribed audio tracks are automatically played.

Note that this example hardcodes a token we generated for you that expires in 2 hours. In a real app, you’ll need your server to generate a token for you.

// !! Note !!

// This sample hardcodes a token which expires in 2 hours.

const

val

wsURL

=

"<your LiveKit server URL>"

const

val

token

=

"<generate a token>"

// In production you should generate tokens on your server, and your frontend

// should request a token from your server.
