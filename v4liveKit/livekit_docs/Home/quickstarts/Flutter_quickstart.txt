Getting started guide

This guide covers the basic setup for a new Flutter app for iOS, Android, or web using LiveKit.

Install LiveKit SDK

flutter pub

add

livekit_client

Permissions and entitlements

You'll need to request camera and/or microphone permissions (depending on your use case). This must be done within your platform-specific code:

Android

Web

Windows

iOS

macOS

Camera and microphone usage need to be declared in your

Info.plist

file.

<

dict

>

...

<

key

>

NSCameraUsageDescription

</

key

>

<

string

>

$(PRODUCT_NAME) uses your camera

</

string

>

<

key

>

NSMicrophoneUsageDescription

</

key

>

<

string

>

$(PRODUCT_NAME) uses your microphone

</

string

>

...

</

dict

>

Your application can still run a voice call when it is switched to the background if the background mode is enabled. Select the app target in Xcode, click the Capabilities tab, enable Background Modes, and check

Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture

.

Your

Info.plist

should have the following entries:

<

key

>

UIBackgroundModes

</

key

>

<

array

>

<

string

>

audio

</

string

>

</

array

>

(LiveKit strongly recommends using Flutter 3.3.0+. If you are using Flutter 3.0.0 or below, please see

this note in the SDK README

.)

Permissions are configured in

AppManifest.xml

. In addition to camera and microphone, you may need to add networking and bluetooth permissions.

Add the following entries to your

macos/Runner/Info.plist

:

<

key

>

NSCameraUsageDescription

</

key

</

key

>

<

string

>

$(PRODUCT_NAME) uses your microphone

</

string

>

You might also need the following entitlements, for both

DebugProfile.entitlements

and

Release.entitlements

(in

macos/Runner/

):

<

key

com.apple.security.device.camera

</

key

>

<

true

/>

<

key

com.apple.security.device.microphone

</

key

>

<

/>

<

key

com.apple.security.device.audio-input

</

key

>

<

true

/>

<

key

>

com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only

</

key

<

key

>

com.apple.security.network.server

</

key

>

<

true

/>

On Windows,

Visual Studio 2019

is required (note that the link in Flutter docs may download VS 2022).

Add the following permissions to your

web/index.html

file:

<

meta

name

=

"

permissions-policy

"

content

=

Connect to LiveKit

Add the following code to connect and publish audio/video to a room:

final

roomOptions

=

RoomOptions

(

adaptiveStream

:

true

,

dynacast

:

true

,

// ... your room options

)

final

room

Room

(

)

;

await

room

.

connect

(

url

,

token

,

roomOptions

:

roomOptions

)

;

try

{

// video will fail when running in ios simulator

await

room

.

localParticipant

.

setCameraEnabled

(

true

)

;

}

catch

(

error

)

{

print

(

'Could not publish video, error:

$

error

'

)

;

}
