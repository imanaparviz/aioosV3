Voice AI quickstart

To build your first voice AI app for React Native, use the following quickstart and the starter app. Otherwise follow the getting started guide below.

Getting started guide

The following guide walks you through the steps to build a video-conferencing application using React Native. It uses the

LiveKit React Native SDK

to render the UI and communicate with LiveKit servers via WebRTC. By the end, you will have a basic video-conferencing application you can run with multiple participants.

Install LiveKit SDK

Install the LiveKit SDK:

npm

install

@livekit/react-native @livekit/react-native-webrtc livekit-client

Integrate into your project

Android

Swift

This library depends on @livekit/react-native-webrtc, which has additional installation instructions for

Android

.

Once the @livekit/react-native-webrtc dependency is installed, one last step is required. In your MainApplication.java file:

import

com

.

livekit

.

reactnative

.

LiveKitReactNative

;

import

com

.

livekit

.

reactnative

.

audio

.

AudioType

;

public

class

MainApplication

extends

Application

implements

ReactApplication

{

@Override

public

void

onCreate

(

)

{

// Place this above any other RN related initialization

// When the AudioType is omitted, it'll default to CommunicationAudioType.

// Use AudioType.MediaAudioType if user is only consuming audio, and not publishing

LiveKitReactNative

.

setup

(

this

,

new

AudioType

.

CommunicationAudioType

(

)

)

;

//...

}

}

This library depends on

@livekit/react-native-webrtc

, which has additional installation instructions for

iOS

.

Once the

@livekit/react-native-webrtc

dependency is installed, one last step is required. In your

AppDelegate.m

file:

#

import

"LivekitReactNative.h"

@implementation

AppDelegate

-

(

BOOL

)

application

:

(

UIApplication

*

)

application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions

:

(

NSDictionary

*

)

launchOptions

{

// Place this above any other RN related initialization

[

LivekitReactNative setup

]

;

//...

}

If you are using Expo, LiveKit is available on Expo through development builds.

See the instructions found here

.

Finally, in your index.js file, setup the LiveKit SDK by calling

registerGlobals()

. This sets up the required WebRTC libraries for use in Javascript, and is needed for LiveKit to work.

import

{

registerGlobals

}

from

'@livekit/react-native'

;

// ...

registerGlobals

(

)

;
