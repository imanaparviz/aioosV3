Getting started guide

This guide covers the basics to connect to LiveKit from a JavaScript app.

Install LiveKit SDK

Install the LiveKit SDK:

yarn

npm

yarn

add

livekit-client

npm

install

livekit-client

--save

Join a room

Note that this example hardcodes a token. In a real app, you’ll need your server to generate a token for you.

import

{

Room

}

from

'livekit-client'

;

const

wsURL

=

'<your LiveKit server URL>'

;

const

token

=

'<generate a token>'

;

const

room

=

new

Room

(

)

;

await

room

.

connect

(

wsURL

,

token

)

;

console

.

log

(

'connected to room'

,

room

.

name

)

;

// Publish local camera and mic tracks

await

room

.

localParticipant

.

enableCameraAndMicrophone

(

)

;
