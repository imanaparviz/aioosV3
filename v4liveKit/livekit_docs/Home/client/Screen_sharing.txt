Overview

LiveKit supports screen sharing natively across all platforms. Your screen is published as a video track, just like your camera. Some platforms support local audio sharing as well.

The steps are somewhat different for each platform:

JavaScript

Swift

Android

Flutter

Unity (WebGL)

// The browser will prompt the user for access and offer a choice of screen, window, or tab

await

room

.

localParticipant

.

setScreenShareEnabled

(

true

)

;

On iOS, LiveKit integrates with ReplayKit in two modes:

In-app capture (default)

: For sharing content within your app

Broadcast capture

: For sharing screen content even when users switch to other apps

In-app capture

The default in-app capture mode requires no additional configuration, but shares only the current application.

localParticipant

.

setScreenShare

(

enabled

:

true

)

Broadcast capture

To share the full screen while your app is running in the background, you'll need to set up a Broadcast Extension. This will allow the user to "Start Broadcast". You can prompt this from your app or the user can start it from the control center.

The full steps are described in our

iOS screen sharing guide

, but a summary is included below:

Add a new "Broadcast Upload Extension" target with the bundle identifier

<your-app-bundle-identifier>.broadcast

.

Replace the default

SampleHandler.swift

with the following:

import

LiveKit

#if

os

(

iOS

)

@available

(

macCatalyst

13.1

,

*

)

class

SampleHandler

:

LKSampleHandler

{

override

var

enableLogging

:

Bool

{

true

}

}

#endif

Add both your main app and broadcast extension to a common App Group, named

group.<your-app-bundle-identifier>

.

Present the broadcast dialog from your app:

localParticipant

.

setScreenShare

(

enabled

:

true

)

On Android, screen capture is performed using

MediaProjectionManager

:

// Create an intent launcher for screen capture

// This *must* be registered prior to onCreate(), ideally as an instance val

val

screenCaptureIntentLauncher

=

registerForActivityResult

(

ActivityResultContracts

.

StartActivityForResult

(

)

)

{

result

->

val

resultCode

=

result

.

resultCode

val

data

=

result

.

data

if

(

resultCode

!=

Activity

.

RESULT_OK

||

data

==

null

)

{

return

@registerForActivityResult

}

lifecycleScope

.

launch

{

room

.

localParticipant

.

setScreenShareEnabled

(

true

,

data

)

}

}

// When it's time to enable the screen share, perform the following

val

mediaProjectionManager

=

getSystemService

(

MEDIA_PROJECTION_SERVICE

)

as

MediaProjectionManager

screenCaptureIntentLauncher

.

launch

(

mediaProjectionManager

.

createScreenCaptureIntent

(

)

)

room

.

localParticipant

.

setScreenShareEnabled

(

true

)

;

On Android, you would have to define a foreground service in your AndroidManifest.xml:

<

manifest

xmlns:

android

=

"

http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android

"

>

<

application

>

...

<

service

android:

name

=

"

de.julianassmann.flutter_background.IsolateHolderService

"

android:

enabled

=

"

true

"

android:

exported

=

"

false

"

android:

foregroundServiceType

=

"

mediaProjection

"

/>

</

application

>

</

manifest

>

On iOS, follow

this guide

to set up a Broadcast Extension.

yield

return

currentRoom

.

LocalParticipant

.

SetScreenShareEnabled

(

true

)

;

Sharing browser audio

Note

Audio sharing is only possible in certain browsers. Check browser support on the

MDN compatibility table

.

To share audio from a browser tab, you can use the

createScreenTracks

method with the audio option enabled:

const

tracks

=

await

localParticipant

.

createScreenTracks

(

{

audio

:

true

,

}

)

;

tracks

.

forEach

(

(

track

)

=>

{

localParticipant

.

publishTrack

(

track

)

;

}

)

;

Testing audio sharing

Publisher

When sharing audio, make sure you select a

Browser Tab

(not a Window) and ☑️ Share tab audio, otherwise no audio track will be generated when calling

createScreenTracks

:

Subscriber

On the receiving side, you can use

RoomAudioRenderer

to play all audio tracks of the room automatically,

AudioTrack

or your own custom

<audio>

tag to add the track to the page. If you don't hear any sound, check you're receiving the track from the server:

JavaScript

room

.

getParticipantByIdentity

(

'<participant_id>'

)

.

getTrackPublication

(

'screen_share_audio'

)

;
