Overview

Each LiveKit Cloud plan includes resource quotas and limits on a per-project basis. The following guide includes precise definitions and information about these limits, why they exist, and how increase them.

Quotas

Most features of LiveKit Cloud are metered, meaning that you are charged based on the amount of each resource that you use. Every plan includes a default allotment for each of these resources, referred to as a "quota". If you exceed this value, additional usage is billed incrementally based on the pricing for that plan.

For projects on the free Build plan, the quota is a hard limit. Additionally, this quota is shared among all of a user's free projects. Creating additional projects does not increase the total available quota. After you exceed your quota, new requests will fail.

Quotas for all plans resets on the first day of each calendar month. Unused quota does not roll over to the next month.

Refer to the latest

pricing page

for the current pricing and quotas for each plan.

Metered resources

The following table includes a definition of each metered resource as well as the default quota included on the free Build plan.

Inference credits

The monthly quota for LiveKit Inference is expressed in

credits

, measured in USD. These credits can be used for any combination of supported

models

. Unused credits do not roll over to the next month.

Limits

LiveKit Cloud places concurrency and/or rate limits on a number of services. These limits are designed to ensure the stability of the network and to prevent abuse, not to limit usage. As with quotas, these limits are higher on higher-priced plans and projects on the free Build plan share their limits with all of a user's free projects.

You can view the current limits on your project at any time in the

LiveKit Cloud

dashboard by navigating to

Settings

and selecting the

Project

tab.

Concurrency limits

Many connections to LiveKit Cloud are persistent or long-lived, using WebRTC or WebSockets. These connections have a

concurrency limit

, which is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be established. When you exceed this limit, new connections of the same type fail until other connections are closed.

The following table shows the different types of persistent connection, and the default concurrency limits on the Build plan.

LiveKit Inference LLM limits

Unlike STT and TTS, which are served through WebSockets, LLM models are served through a stateless HTTP API. This allows for more flexibility in usage, but requires a different approach to limits. The goal is to support the same number of concurrent sessions as with STT and TTS, but due to application variance in terms of request rate and token usage, the service has two rate limits: requests per minute (RPM) and tokens per minute (TPM). If either limit is reached, new requests will fail. These limits are enforced in a sliding window of 60 seconds.

The following table shows the default rate limits on the Build plan. For rate limits on paid plans, refer to the latest

pricing

.

Egress time limits

The LiveKit Cloud

Egress service

has time limits, which vary based on the output type. The following table shows the default limits for all plan types.

Egress output

Time limit

File output (MP4, OGG, WebM)

3 hours

HLS segments

12 hours

HLS/RTMP streaming

12 hours

Raw single stream (track)

12 hours

When these time limits are reached, any in-progress egress automatically ends with the status

LIMIT_REACHED

.

You can listen for this status change using the

egress_ended

webhook

.

Media subscription limits

Each active participant can only subscribe to a limited number of individual media tracks at once. The following table shows the default limits for all plan types.

Track type

Limit

Video

100

Audio

100

For high volume video use cases, consider using pagination and

selective subscriptions

to keep the number of

subscriptions within these limits.

Server API rate limits

All projects have a

Server API

rate limit of 1,000 requests per minute. This applies to requests such as to the

RoomService

or

EgressService

, not to SDK methods like joining a room or sending data packets. Requests to

LiveKit Inference

have their

own rate limits

.

Requesting increases

Customers on the Scale plan can request an increase for specific limits in their

project settings

.

Agent cold starts

Projects on the Build plan might have their deployed agents shut down after all active sessions end. The agent automatically starts again when a new session begins. This can cause up to 10 to 20 seconds of delay before the agent joins the room.

Custom plans

LiveKit can work with you to ensure your project has the capacity it needs.
