Overview

Region pinning restricts network traffic to a specific geographical region. Use this feature to comply with local telephony regulations or data residency requirements.

There are two options for restricting traffic to a specific region:

Protocol-based region pinning

Signaling and transport protocols include region selection. Use this option with LiveKit realtime SDKs.

Region-based endpoint

Clients connect to a region-specific endpoint. Use this option for telephony applications. To learn more, see

SIP cloud and region pinning

.

Protocol-based region pinning

In protocol-based region pinning, region selection information is embedded in the initial signaling and transport messages. When pinning is enabled, if the initial connection is routed to a server outside the allowed regions, the request is rejected. The client then retries the connection using a server in one of the pinned regions.

Region pinning is available for customers on the

Scale plan

or higher.

Protocol-based region pinning only works with LiveKit realtime SDKs

For SIP requests, the server rejects the connection and doesn't retry it. Use

region-based endpoints

for SIP.

When to use protocol-based region pinning

When connecting with LiveKit realtime SDKs or when regional data residency (for example, GDPR compliance) is required.

Enabling protocol-based region pinning

LiveKit must enable region pinning for your project. To request region pinning, sign in to

LiveKit Cloud

and select the

Support

option in the menu.

Considerations

When you enable region pinning, you turn off automatic failover to the nearest region in the case of an outage.
